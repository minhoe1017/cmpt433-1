# Enter directory with root makefile and execute:
	$ make

# Note: I included node_modules in the aforementioned directory
# but you can (and should for testing purposes) GO TO your corresponding
# ../public/node/BeagleBone-Beat-Box-copy and execute (ON HOST):
	$ node server.js

# Then on Beaglebone run appropriate networking steps to enable internet access with BeagleBone
# then once mounted via mount shell...execute (ON TARGET):
	1) Change to public shared directory:
		# cd /mnt/remote/myApps
	2) Run the created executable (should be named audio):
		# ./audio

# Now open up a web-browser and type in url:
	localhost:8088		--OR--		127.0.0.1:8088
